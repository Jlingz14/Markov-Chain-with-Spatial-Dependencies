# Markov-Chain-with-Spatial-Dependencies
This code applies a variant of the Markov chain that explicitly incorporates spatial effects. It is an extension of the Markov class allowing a more complete analysis of the spatial dimensions of transition dynamics. The aim is to provide a methodology for applying the explicit model to spatial dependency analysis.
Here, the question is to study and quantify whether neighborhood context affects transitional dynamics. Rather than estimating a homogeneous law, the model requires the estimation of k transition laws each dependent on spatial neighbor state.

# Code explanation 
This article used published data on confirmed cases of Covidâ€™19 in the 22 regions of Madagascar. These data were discretized to obtain a discrete state of propagation intensity.
